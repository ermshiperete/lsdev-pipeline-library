# SIL LSDev Pipeline Library

This git repository contains a library of reusable [Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)
steps and functions that can be used in a Jenkinsfile to help improve the Continuous Delivery pipeline.

The idea is to try promote sharing of scripts across projects where it makes sense.
